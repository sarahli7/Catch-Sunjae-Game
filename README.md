This game features characters from a recently aired and popular show, Lovely Runner. 
The girl in the game is Im Sol, who travels back in time to prevent the death of her future partner, Sunjae, as he sacrifices his life to ensure Im Solâ€™s safety. 
However, Sunjae in the past does not know who Im Sol is and is terrified of her words. 
So Sunjae (the bot in the game) will attempt to go to different directions to avoid contact with the player. 

As Im Sol, the player's main objective is to reach Sunjae before time runs out. 
Im Sol's suitor acts as a bot character and an obstacle that must be avoided to save time, similar to how it was depicted in the show.


The player has 3 minutes to save Sunjae in each attempt. If the timer runs out, Sunjae meets his fated death. 
Regardless, Im Sol has a total of 3 attempts to save him. If Im Sol fails to save Sunjae in all three lifetimes, the game is over. 
After each failed attempt, a family-friendly picture illustrating Sunjae's death, as depicted in the show, will appear, and the counter for the number of time travels remaining decreases by 1.
If the game is over, a messagebox will appear, asking the player to exit by clicking OK. 

If the player manages to catch the target before the game finishes, the music will change to another song from the show, often presented during a heartfelt scene.
As the music plays, a messagebox will appear prompting the user to try again or to exit. 

The controls are simply W (up), S (down), A (left), D (right, WD (diagonally up and right), SD (diagonally down and right), WA (diagonally up and left), SA (diagonally down and left).
