      This game features characters from a recently aired and popular show, Lovely Runner. The girl in the game is Im Sol, who travels back in time to prevent the death of her future partner, Sunjae, as he sacrifices his life to ensure Im Sol’s safety. However, Sunjae in the past does not know who Im Sol is and is terrified of her words. As Im Sol, the player's main objective is to reach Sunjae before time runs out. Im Sol's suitor acts as a bot character and an obstacle that must be avoided to save time, similar to how it was depicted in the show.      The player has 3 minutes to save Sunjae in each attempt. If the timer runs out, Sunjae meets his fated death. Regardless, Im Sol has a total of 3 attempts to save him. If Im Sol fails to save Sunjae in all three lifetimes, the game is over. After each failed attempt, a family-friendly picture illustrating Sunjae's death, as depicted in the show, will appear.
